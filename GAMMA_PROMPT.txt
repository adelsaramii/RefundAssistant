PROJECT: Refund Assistant - AI-Powered Refund Decision System

OVERVIEW:
A full-stack intelligent refund management system for food delivery platforms that combines rule-based decision engines with AI text analysis to automate refund requests, reduce fraud, and save costs.

PROBLEM:
- Food delivery platforms waste 15+ minutes per refund request
- Inconsistent decisions across agents
- High fraud risk (customers gaming the system)
- Poor customer experience (slow responses)
- No visibility into refund costs and optimization

SOLUTION:
Intelligent system that analyzes refund requests in <30 seconds with:
- 8 business rules (delivery delay, customer history, restaurant reliability, photo evidence, etc.)
- OpenAI GPT-4 text analysis extracting insights from complaint text
- Explainable AI recommendations (APPROVE/REJECT/PARTIAL) with confidence scores
- Dynamic policy management (adjust rules on the fly)
- Business impact calculator (ROI forecasting)

TECH STACK:
Backend: Python FastAPI + OpenAI GPT-4 + 8-factor rule engine
Frontend: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Deployment: Render.com (backend) + mindportal.cloud (frontend)
GitHub: https://github.com/adelsaramii/RefundAssistant (backend)
        https://github.com/adelsaramii/refund-console (frontend)

KEY FEATURES:
1. Case Queue - Browse, filter, search refund cases with smart filters
2. AI Analysis - Natural language processing extracts 10+ signals from complaints
3. Explainable Decisions - Every recommendation shows reasoning and confidence
4. Policy Manager - Configure rules, weights, presets (Strict/Friendly/Tolerant)
5. Impact Dashboard - Calculate ROI and savings projections
6. Real-time Processing - <500ms response time per case

BUSINESS VALUE:
TIME SAVINGS: 15 minutes → 30 seconds per case (97% reduction)
COST SAVINGS: 10-20% reduction in refund costs = $50K-$200K+/year
FRAUD PREVENTION: 15%+ improvement in fraud detection
AUTOMATION: 80% of cases handled without human intervention
SCALABILITY: Handle 10x volume without adding staff

ROI EXAMPLE (1,000 orders/day, 5% complaint rate):
- Current annual refund cost: $328,500
- With 10% improvement: Save $32,850/year
- Agent time saved: 456 hours/year
- ROI: 300%+ in first year
